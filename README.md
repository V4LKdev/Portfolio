## Technical Stack
- **Frontend**: React 18, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **UI Components**: Custom components with shadcn/ui integration
- **Video**: HTML5 with cookie-based preference persistence
- **Network Stats**: Real-time HTTP latency and packet loss measurement
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with Tailwind breakpoints

## Architecture
- `src/components/Portfolio.tsx` - Main responsive portfolio component with video game aesthetics
- `src/components/sections/` - Individual page sections (Home, Projects, About, etc.)
- `src/components/ui/` - Reusable UI components
- `src/content/` - Content configuration and data
- `src/lib/` - Utilities and helper functions

## Development Workflow & Principles

### Architecture Principles
- **Component-Based Design**: Modular React components with clear separation of concerns
- **TypeScript First**: Strict typing for better code quality and developer experience
- **Mobile-First Responsive**: Built with Tailwind CSS breakpoints (mobile â†’ tablet â†’ desktop)
- **Game-Inspired UX**: Clean, modern UI with video game aesthetics and smooth interactions
- **Performance Optimized**: Video management, efficient re-renders, and optimized asset loading
- **Accessibility**: Proper ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, and semantic HTML

### Git Workflow & Version Management

#### Branch Structure
- **`main`**: Production-ready source code
- **`releases`**: Production build artifacts for deployment tracking

#### Build & Release Process
1. **Development**: Work on features in `main` branch
2. **Build**: `npm run build` creates production files in `dist/`
3. **Release**: Production builds are committed to `releases` branch with version tags
4. **Deploy**: Deploy from `releases` branch with traceable build IDs

#### Commands
```bash
# Development
npm run dev          # Start development server
npm run lint         # Run ESLint checks
npm run build        # Create production build

# Release Process
npm run build                           # Create production build
git checkout releases                   # Switch to releases branch
# Copy dist/ contents to releases branch root
git add . && git commit -m "build: production build vX.XX.XX_vXX"
git push origin releases               # Push release to GitHub
git checkout main                      # Return to development
```

### Build ID System
- **Format**: `v2025.07_v01` (year.month_version)
- **Location**: Displayed in bottom-left corner of main menu
- **Purpose**: Match deployed versions to git commits in `releases` branch
- **Updates**: Increment for each production release

### Development Guidelines

#### TypeScript
- Strict mode disabled for flexibility during rapid development
- Interface definitions in content files for data structures
- Proper typing for component props and state

#### Styling
- **Tailwind CSS** for all styling with custom game-inspired classes
- **CSS Custom Properties** for theme colors and dynamic values
- **Responsive Design** using Tailwind breakpoints (`sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`, `xl:`)
- **Game Aesthetics**: Amber color scheme, atmospheric glows, backdrop blur

#### Performance
- **Video Optimization**: Cookie-based preferences, memory management
- **Component Optimization**: useCallback for expensive operations
- **Asset Management**: Optimized images, efficient imports
- **Build Optimization**: Vite bundling with tree-shaking

#### Code Quality
- **ESLint**: Configured with React and TypeScript rules
- **Prettier**: Consistent code formatting
- **Clean Code**: Descriptive variable names, commented complex logic
- **No Unused Code**: Regular cleanup of unused imports and components

### File Conventions
- **Components**: PascalCase (`Portfolio.tsx`)
- **Hooks**: camelCase with `use` prefix (`useToast.ts`)
- **Content**: camelCase (`ui-config.ts`)
- **Utilities**: camelCase (`utils.ts`)
- **Types**: PascalCase interfaces and types

### Content Management
- **Centralized Data**: All content in `src/content/` directory
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript interfaces for all data structures
- **Easy Updates**: Modify content files without touching components
- **Modular Exports**: Clean imports through `content/index.ts`
