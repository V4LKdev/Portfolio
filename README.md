# TODO

## Feature
- [x] Replace YouTube embed on Home with an optimized local video player (custom React component, efficient, persistent, and memory-optimized).
  <!-- Complete! Uses HTML5 video, cookies for preferences, and smart resource management. -->
- [ ] Add Night/Day mode toggle (not just dark/light, but warm/yellow vs. cool/blue themes).
  <!-- Excellent for personalization and mood. Not difficult with Tailwind or CSS variables, but will require some design planning. -->
- [ ] Add transition animations when opening subpages from the main menu.
  <!-- Very doable with Framer Motion or React Transition Group. Subtle transitions can greatly improve feel. -->
- [ ] Add a button/link to GitHub repo or project download on Project Details page, only if available.
  <!-- Standard for portfolios, easy to conditionally render. -->
- [ ] Add Social Media icons to the bottom of the main page.
  <!-- Simple and effective for networking. -->
- [ ] [Future] Improve video quality and compression (test AV1, adaptive streaming, or higher bitrates as server allows).
  <!-- Consider AV1, H.265, or adaptive streaming for best quality/size balance. -->

## Style
- [ ] Overhaul color scheme; implement Night/Day (warm/cool) themes.
  <!-- Good for branding and accessibility. Consider using Tailwind's theming or CSS custom properties. -->
- [ ] Make the button menu look and behave more like a game main menu.
  <!-- Fun idea! Can use custom fonts, sound, hover effects, and layout. Very feasible. -->
- [ ] Edit the "Available for freelance" box to look like a video game server connection panel, showing general location (e.g., Germany) and fake or real network stats (ping, packet loss).
  <!-- Very creative! Fake stats are easy; real-time ping to your server is possible but requires backend/API work. -->
- [ ] Overwatch 2-style Projects page: List project genres as "Game Modes" (Singleplayer, Multiplayer, Competitive, Custom, etc.), then show projects in each category on click.
  <!-- Unique and memorable! Not too much for a portfolio if well-organized. Can be implemented with nested menus or tabs. -->

## Feel
- [ ] Make project cards and menu more interactive (hover, tilt, sound, etc.).
  <!-- Adds polish and game-like feel. Use Framer Motion, CSS, or small sound libraries. -->
- [ ] Ensure subpage transitions are smooth and game-like.
  <!-- See above, very feasible. -->

## Content
- [ ] Project Details: Improve layout for images, code (with syntax highlighting), and YouTube embeds. Ensure vertical alignment so tabs are equally long, with blank space if needed.
  <!-- This is a bit tricky but possible with CSS grid/flexbox and careful layout planning. Syntax highlighting is easy with Prism.js or Highlight.js. -->
- [ ] Add more links, writeups, and polish to project details as needed.
  <!-- Always a good idea! -->
